In particular, we know that the most severe cases of Covid-19 require the use of ventilators, which are only supported at hospital facilities. In this report, I'll look at the relationship per zip code in NYC with the number of infections compared to the nearest hospitals. Longterm the city might want to reconsider the allocation of this equipment in order to allow for a faster resonse to future waves of the virus.</p>\n  "

I paired this data with zip code data for NYC that also contained the GeoJson data.</p>\n<p>In order to find the hospital information, I first pulled a list of voting locations around NYC using publicly available data from the the New York State registrar. Voting locations are spaced out in order to optimize for population density. Using the location data from these locations, I then used Foursquare to find hospitals within a 1000m radius. This coverage, and using voting locations, ensured that I would collect all data on registered hospitals in the city.</p>\n"

This revealed an initial result of showing the larger number of cases in the outer borough of the city. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this wasn't nearly enough information. I further looked to see what the mean number of cases per neighborhood, and eventually looked into raw total numbers as percentages of the total infections. It became immediately clear that even in the outer boroughs certain neighborhoods had a higher rate of positive cases. The most obvious examples were Elmhurst, Queens (2,919 infections; 17 nearby hospitals) and Parkside Projects, Bronx; 11 nearby Hospitals). On the opposite side were Midtown East, Manhattan (252 infections; 37 nearby hospitals).</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, I concluded that mapping this information would reveal the most identifiable clusters and allow for a meta-analysis of the data.</p>"
